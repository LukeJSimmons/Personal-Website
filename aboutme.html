                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <h2>Personally</h2>
                <p><strong>I’m Luke! I’m an aspiring creator of all sorts. I love making programs, art, music, games, and more.
                    I’m most skilled in programming and am looking to build a career in it.
                    My love for creating comes from my love for my Creator. I seek to honor and glorify Him in all that I do.</strong></p>
                <h2>Professionally</h2>
                <div>
                    <p><strong>I love scheduling.</strong> Not something everybody can say, but completely true for me! I schedule everything, even down to the hour. 
                        I find it not only useful, but fun too. Why else would I spend so much time on Google Calendar!</p>
                    <p><strong>I make my own path.</strong> Most guys float their way through highschool then into college solely because that's what people do. I refused.
                        I worked hard enough to graduate highschool a year early and start a business apprenticeship program called Praxis. It gave me direction and equipped me to go with courage and make it happen.</p>
                    <p><strong>I love learning and do it constantly.</strong> I especially love jumping into new things and learning by doing.
                        This is how I learned everything I know. I didn't take a class for game development, I made games. I didn't take a class for graphic design, I designed graphics.
                        I didn't take a class for building websites, I built a website.</p>
                    <p><strong>I love making people smile.</strong> Seems cliche, because it is! But I truly love brightening up others' days.
                        Working at Chick-Fil-A has really ingrained this in me. I don't just smile and say "My pleasure!". I try to make real relationships with people.
                        The kind where if I run into someone outside of work they would be happy to see me.</p>
                    <p><strong>If you want someone who loves to learn fast and work passionately, reach out and let's talk!</strong></p>

                <p class="left"><em>August 2023 - Present</em></p>
                <p>Treating people with gentleness and respect is exactly what I learned and put into practice at Chick-Fil-A. It's a very fast paced and stressful environment.
                    I love making those little moments count and making someone smile. I now find myself making connections with people even outside of work.
